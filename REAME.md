# Spam phone numbers in France
Presented as a black list file for NCID (http://ncid.sourceforge.net)

Used with a Raspberry Pi + modem, as per https://projectaweek.com/2016/11/29/network-caller-id-ncid-install-on-raspberry-pi/

This is a work in progress.

There should be a public API of these numbers, something to think about.
